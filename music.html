        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I designed, prototyped and usability tested a music player
          application for touchscreen smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did this for fun and practise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed an interactive prototype using Figma. I usability
          tested the prototype with some participants remotely and some
          in-person.

    <!-- Design Motivation -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Design Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          This design had two sources of inspiration. The first was
          material I had been reading about the ergonomics of smartphone
          interaction. The second was observations I’d made about how
          people listen to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that user-centred design (UCD) processes, that use
          user research, are the best way to design. However, I did not
          use a full UCD process for this project because my motivations
          for this project were to practise specific skills and explore
          specific ideas.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-follow">Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>
          Typically when using a smartphone the hand is used to both hold
          the device and to interact with it. The thumb is used for most
          interactions with the screen such as tapping, dragging and swiping.
          These <b>thumb interactions are constrained by the hands hold of the
          phone and the thumbs morphology</b>. The thumb has limited reach and
          the movements to access different parts of the screen can differ
          notably. Consequently, <b>the usability of the touchscreen varies
          across the surface of the screen</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the usability varies has been researched. This research has
          resulted in design recommendations including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position inputs in the top right and middle left areas of the
            phone. Do not position them in top left and bottom right
            (Trudeau et al, 2012).
          </li>
          <li>
            Position the most frequent targets in the center of the screen
            (Park and Han, 2010).
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t position inputs on the extremes of the functional area
            (Bergstrom-Lehtovirta and Oulasvirta, 2014).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The functional area refers to the area of the screen the user
          can reach when holding the device in their rest grip. In short,
          it excludes the corners of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, <b>there is a strong argument to position inputs toward
          the center of the screen and not the corners</b>. Despite this, many
          current applications position input in the corners of the screen.
          <b>I used this project to explore applying these design
          recommendations.</b>
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Listening to Music</h3>
        <p>
          People listen to songs in series. That series may be an album,
          a playlist or a queue - I will refer to these collectively as
          playlists. Current apps place a lot focus on the song being
          currently played. In comparison the playlist is given a minor
          role. I hypothesize that this prioritisation of current song
          and playlist is misaligned with how users interact with music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course I expect that users care about what song is
          currently playing. I also expect that users care more
          about the songs previously played and a lot more about
          the songs soon to be played, then is reflected by current designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          These beliefs have made me interested in <b>designing a music
          application that makes the playlist the lead character</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just my beliefs and assumptions - it’s very possible
          they are completely wrong. If I were working on this for other
          reasons (not primarily to practise prototyping) I would be
          investigating this in depth by researching users.

        <h2 class="header-start">Design & Prototyping</h2>
        <h3 class="header-follow">Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted the playlist to be the core of this application so I
          started the design by considering how I could visually represent
          it. I first explored ideas by making rough paper sketches of
          screen layouts and considering how they could be manipulated
          to introduce functionality. When doing so I was trying to
          apply the ergonomics motivated design recommendations by
          positioning the interactions in the central area of the screen.
          Once I had settled on a general layout I moved to Figma to
          develop the next iterations.

          <h3 class="header-follow">Interactive Prototype Video</h3>
          <!-- TODO fix so video diplays correctly on mobiles -->
          <div class="video-container">
            <video
              class="ucde-video"
              src="./assets/playlist/prototype.mp4"
              controls>
            </video>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Design</h3>
        <p>
          The main screen of the application is ‘Playing Playlist Screen’
          shown below. The playlist is the focus of the application. The
          user is able to see and interact with: the songs previously
          played, the current song and the songs next in the playlist.
        </p>
        <div class="playlist-screen-container">
          <div class="playlist-screen-holder">
            <img class="playlist-screen" src="./assets/playlist/screens/home.svg">
            <h3 class="playlist-screen-label">Playlist Player</h3>
            <h4 class="playlist-screen-label">Playing Playlist Screen</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class=header-follow>Layout</h3>
        <p>
          The ‘Playing Playlist’ screen has a two column layout as
          illustrated below. The first column (blue) spans the majority of
          the screen and is positioned to the left of the screen; this
          column is used as a container to hold the contents of the
          playlist. The column is also scrollable thus is able to
          accomodate playlists of variable size. The column to the
          right (purple) contains playlist controls including play,
          pause and shuffle. The right column is fixed in position.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose this layout because it is well aligned with the design
          recommendations as it enables almost all interactions to be
          positioned in the vertically central region.
        </p>
        <div class="playlist-screen-container">
          <div class="playlist-screen-holder">
            <img class="playlist-screen" src="./assets/playlist/screens/columns.svg">
            <h3 class="playlist-screen-label">Two Column Layout</h3>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Playlist Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
          Three important playlist functions I required the design to
          feature were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Song adding</li>
          <li>Song removal</li>
          <li>Song reordering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The design enables these actions largely using direct manipulation.
          The user is able to insert songs by holding on the position in the
          playlist where they want to place the song. Songs can be dragged
          around to reorder them or dragged out of the list to remove them.
        </p>

        <div class="playlist-screen-container">
          <div class="playlist-screen-holder">

    <!-- Usability Testing -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <h3 class="header-start">Description</h3>
        <p>
          To test the design and learn about how it could be improved I
          decided to run a few think aloud usability tests. I ran two tests
          remotely and one in-person.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the remote tests I set up a video call with the participant such
          that they were able to view their screen and I shared the Figma
          prototype with them. This enabled the participant to interact with the
          prototype, me to observe them and us to converse. A limitation
          of this testing was that they interacted with a simulation of
          a phone using a laptop rather than a physical phone.
          Consequently the validity of the test with respect to
          ergonomics is low. For the in-person test, the participant
          interacted with the prototype on a phone using the Figma mirror app.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-follow">Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Participants struggled to discover the interactions for adding and
          removing songs. This is not too surprising because there is nothing
          to visually indicate their existence. Once the participants had
          experienced the interactions they appeared happy to use
          them going forward. This usability problem could potentially
          be addressed by either adding signifiers to the design or adding
          a tutorial flow to introduce them to new users. Other than
          this, participants did not encounter issues interacting with
          the prototype.
