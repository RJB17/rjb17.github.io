    <h1> Case Study: Playlist Player </h1>
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="content-panel">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I designed, prototyped and usability tested a music player
          application for touchscreen smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did this for fun and practise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed an interactive prototype using Figma. I usability
          tested the prototype with some participants remotely and some
          in-person.

    <!-- Design Motivation -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Design Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          This design had two sources of inspiration. The first was
          material I had been reading about the ergonomics of smartphone
          interaction. The second was observations I’d made about how
          people listen to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that user-centred design (UCD) processes, that use
          user research, are the best way to design. However, I did not
          use a full UCD process for this project because my motivations
          for this project were to practise specific skills and explore
          specific ideas.
        </p>
        <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>
          Typically when using a smartphone the hand is used to both hold
          the device and to interact with it. The thumb is used for most
          interactions with the screen such as tapping, dragging and swiping.
          These <b>thumb interactions are constrained by the hands hold of the
          phone and the thumbs morphology</b>. The thumb has limited reach and
          the movements to access different parts of the screen can differ
          notably. Consequently, <b>the usability of the touchscreen varies
          across the surface of the screen</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the usability varies has been researched. This research has
          resulted in design recommendations including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position inputs in the top right and middle left areas of the
            phone. Do not position them in top left and bottom right
            (Trudeau et al, 2012).
          </li>
          <li>
            Position the most frequent targets in the center of the screen
            (Park and Han, 2010).
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t position inputs on the extremes of the functional area
            (Bergstrom-Lehtovirta and Oulasvirta, 2014).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The functional area refers to the area of the screen the user
          can reach when holding the device in their rest grip. In short,
          it excludes the corners of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, <b>there is a strong argument to position inputs toward
          the center of the screen and not the corners</b>. Despite this, many
          current applications position input in the corners of the screen.
          <b>I used this project to explore applying these design
          recommendations.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>Listening to Music</h3>
        <p>
          People listen to songs in series. That series may be an album,
          a playlist or a queue - I will refer to these collectively as
          playlists. Current apps place a lot focus on the song being
          currently played. In comparison the playlist is given a minor
          role. I hypothesize that this prioritisation of current song
          and playlist is misaligned with how users interact with music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course I expect that users care about what song is
          currently playing. I also expect that users care more
          about the songs previously played and a lot more about
          the songs soon to be played, then is reflected by current designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          These beliefs have made me interested in <b>designing a music
          application that makes the playlist the lead character</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just my beliefs and assumptions - it’s very possible
          they are completely wrong. If I were working on this for other
          reasons (not primarily to practise prototyping) I would be
          investigating this in depth by researching users.
