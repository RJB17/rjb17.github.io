    <!-- Literature Review -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class=" inner-content">
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          First, the existing literature was carefuly reviewed.
          This involved: trawling the recent proceedings of reputable
          conferences; searching key terms; and following up the references
          of relevent publications. In the exisiting literature, the review
          aimed to identify:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the research questions considered</li>
          <li>the methods used</li>
          <li>the results found</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal was to find a gap in the exisiting research
          with motivation to research it. Additionally, an understanding of
          previously used methods would inform the design of this study's
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          A current, open and interesting research area identified was:
          <b>the design and use of tools to help users spot Fake News</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation & Background</h3>
        <p>
          The literature review defined Fake News to be disinformation
          (intentionally false or misleading information) in the
          form of news. Fake News is considered harmful and people are highly
          susceptible to it due to multiple cognitive biases, thus, motivating
          the study of tools to help people spot it.
        </p>
        <h3>Gap</h3>
        <p>
        Existing work found that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>People are bad at spotting Fake News</li>
          <li>People think they are good at detecting Fake News</li>
          <li>People were sceptical of tools to help them detect Fake News</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Existing work had <b>not</b> identified if given tools to help
          them detect Fake News people would use them. This project attempts
          to fill some of this gap.
        </p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          The literature discussed how news consumption is changing with
          social media, eg. Facebook and Twitter, becoming an increasingly
          way to consume news content. Concequently, news consumption through
          social media was deemed an appropriate setting to research.
        </p>

        <h3>Resulting Research Questions</h3>
        <p>
          The literature review provided motivation to research the question:
          <b>do credibility signals in social media news feeds affect users'
          perceptions of the truth of news?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Credibility signals are one form of tool for helping users spot Fake
          News. They are present an estimated level of credibility such as low
          or high. They are a compromise between simpler tools like flags and
          more complex visualisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second research question was identified of: <b>does the task of
          detecting Fake News affect peoples' perceptions of how good they are
          at it?</b>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Experiment -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Experiment</h2>
        <p>
          To investigate the research questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Do credibility signals in social media news feeds affect users'
            perceptions of the truth of news?
          </li>
          <li>
            does the task of detecting Fake News affect peoples' perceptions
            of how good they are at it?
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          a mixed methods study was designed.
        </p>
        <h3>Rating Exercise</h3>
        <p>
          The primary method was a rating exercise. Participants were
          presented with a sequence of news articles and asked to rate how
          true they belived it to be. The articles were designed to appear
          similarly to how they would be presented in a newsfeed.
          The truth ratings were captured ussing a A 5-point
          Likert item with the values:values:
          ‘definitely false’; ‘probably false’; ‘unsure’; ‘probably true’;
          and ‘definitely true’.
        </p>
        <div class="articles">
          <h3>Example Articles</h3>
          <div>
            <div class="article">
              <img
                src="./assets/darp-case-study/N5H.jpg"
                alt=""
                class="center-img"
              >
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <img
                src="./assets/darp-case-study/N1L.jpg"
                alt=""
                class="center-img"

              >
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="slide-nav">
            <div class="slide-btns">
              <button class="slide-dir-btn" onclick="plusArticles(-1)">
                <a class="prev">&#10094;</a>
              </button>
              <a class='article-btn' onclick="currentArticle(1)"></a>
              <a class='article-btn' onclick="currentArticle(2)"></a>
              <button class="slide-dir-btn" onclick="plusArticles(1)">
                <a class="next" >&#10095;</a>
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>


        </div>
        <p>
          Every article was presented with a crediblity signal of either low
          or high value. The levels of the credibility signal formed one
          independent variable of the study. Effects of showing certain
          articles with certain signals were counter-balanced by partitioning
          the participant into two groups such that for each article, the groups
          were presented it with different signals. The group partition formed
          the second independent variable of the study.
        </p>
        <p>
          This resulted in a 2x2
          mixed design, thus, four conditions as summarised by Tables 1 & 2.

        <h3>Questionnaires</h3>
        <p>
          The rating exercise was complemented by pre- and post-questtionnaires.
          The questionnaires had a few different purposes. First they were used
          to collect sociodemographic information to enable an understanding of
          who participated in the study which is important for evaluating the
          studies validity. Second, it gathered information
          relating to potential confounds including: the social media the
          participants used and their familiarity with the articles presented
          in the rating exercise; again this is important for assessing the
          studies validity. The post-questionnaire explored why particpants
          gave the truth ratings they did as well as how influenced they felt
          by the signals and how believable they thought the signals were. This
          information was gathered as it had the potential to help us
          explain the results we collected. Finally, in both the pre- and
          post-questionnaire participants were asked how good they thought
          they were at detecting Fake News. This was asked, repeatedly, to
          identify if the rating exercise decreases self-efficacy.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>We believed that participants would be affected by the signals and
        hypothesised that: high credibility signals in social media news feeds
        will lead users to perceive the article as being more truthful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The existing literature reported people to percieve themselves as
          being good at detecting Fake News but bad in reality. We suspected
          that the task of detecting Fake News may serve as a reality check,
          thus, hypothesised that: the task of rating how true news articles
          are will decrease peoples self efficacy at Fake News detection.
        </p>
        <h3>Running the study</h3>
        <p>
          The study was implemented using Qualtrics. First we piloted the study
          with a small number of participants to identify problems with the
          study and to modify it as necessary. The pilot indicated the study
          was longer than targeted so modifications were made to shorten it. 60
          student participants were recruited by approaching them in communal
          areas of the university such as the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of every session with a participant they were briefed
          about the study and it was explained how their data would be used such
          that they could give informed consent. They were able to withdraw,
          without giving reason, during the experiment. At the end of the study
          they were debriefed and able to ask any questions.
