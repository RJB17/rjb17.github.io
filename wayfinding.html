    <h1> Case Study: Wayfinding </h1>
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          University group project to design and evaluate an interactive
          wayfinding application using user-centred design (UCD) methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked in a team of 4. I contributed significantly to all parts
          of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was the assessment for a user-centred design module
           studied as part of a MSc in Human-centred Interactive Technologies.

    <!-- Problem -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Design a wayfinding application to assist people in navigating the
          University's campuses.
        </p>
        <p>The application must allow users to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for the location of a room within a building.</li>
          <li>Get directions to a room or building.</li>
          <li>Tailor routes based on specified criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The target users were members of the University.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Process -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <img
          class="center-img process-svg"
          src="./assets/wayfinding/process.svg"
        >
        <p>
          A user-centred design process was used. It was restricted by the
          assessment specifications to involve certain activities.
          The process comprised 4 sets of activities: user research,
          personas & scenarios, design & prototyping and usability testing.
          The above diagram illustrates the sequence of activities.
          Design & prototyping has a cyclic relationship with usability
          testing because usability testing was used to inform modifications
          of the design. This case study will next discuss each of the
          activities in turn.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- User Research  -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        The foundation of good user-centred design is good user research.
        For this project the main user research activity was semi-structured
        interviews. The interviews were informed and complemented by an audit
        of related products and the creation of a persona hypothesis.

        <h3 class="header-follow">Related Product Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Relevant existing services were examined to understand how they
          address user goals and needs. The services investigated were:
          Google Maps, the University's own interactive map, and physical
          navigation signs around the University's campuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate each service, it was identified if it implemented each of
          the functions our design was required to and how usable the
          implementation was. Usability was evaluated by considering how well
          it achieved usability goals. The evaluation could have been improved
          by instead using an expert evaluation method.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Persona Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          A personas hypothesis (PH) predicts who the users are and their
          needs and goals. It is based on both demographic information
          and behavioural patterns. The PH helps identify who should be
          interviewed and interview topics.
          Additionally, it documents the designers assumptions
          enabling them to be critiqued.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the target users, members of the University,
          the PH considered a range of behavioural patterns including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why do users travel? eg. for class, to shop, to socialise.</li>
          <li>When do users travel? eg. during the working day, at night.</li>
          <li>Where are users travelling to? eg. Library, Cafe, Gym.</li>
          <li>How do users travel? eg. walk, bus, bike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Semi-structured Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          The team conducted 20 semi-structured interviews (SSI) to learn
          about the users and their goals. Interviews were conducted in pairs
          such that one member acted as the interviewer and the second
          as a notetaker. Google Forms was used to capture the
          participants’ responses. I, and the teammate I worked with,
          conducted 14 interviews and alternated roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assessment specification required the use of either
          questionnaires or user interviews. SSI were chosen because of
          their flexibility. The SSI format is flexible because it allows
          the interviewer to probe the participant and for the format to
          be modified during the interview process. This flexibility
          enabled us to use SSI to quickly gain an in-depth understanding
          of the target users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interviews were designed to be about 15 minutes long.
          This length was chosen because it would allow for us to
          recruit and interview a suitable number of participants
          within our time constraints. The interviews consisted of
          three sections. The first section captured the participant’s
          background. The second section explored the participant’s goals
          when interacting with campus. The third section investigated
          their current experience when interacting with campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the project had been less constrained by time and the
          specification, a combination of methods could have been used
          to gain a broader and more in-depth understanding of users.
          Questionnaires would have enabled us to reach a larger and
          more diverse set of users. Combining SSI with contextual
          inquiry would have enabled a more in depth understanding of users’
          existing practices and goals.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Ethics</h3>
        <p>
          Research must be conducted ethically. Before starting each
          interview, the participant was briefed about: what the
          interview would involve, how their data would be used,
          and it was explained that they could stop participating
          at anypoint without giving reason. This enabled us to get
          the participant’s informed consent to interview them.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-follow">Findings</h3>
        <p>
          A lot was learnt about the users and their goals from the user
          research. This section shall describe a few of the findings
          that significantly influenced the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was found that participants were typically either time-table
          focused or independent study focused. The former group have
          busy timetables that dictate where they need to be and when
          they need to be there. On the other hand, independent study
          focused participants have few timetabled events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research identified that people do not often visit new places.
          Typically, they just visit new places at the start of term when they
          are scheduled tuition in new rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was found that major factors affecting how people choose to
          travel were: weather conditions and notions of convenience and
          comfort. Many participants want to stay warm and dry and some
          prefer taking the bus to walking. Other participants simply
          want their travel time to be as short as possible.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The research data was modelled using two personas named Delores and
          Lee. The personas attempt to model the behavioural patterns, goals
          and frustrations found during user research. Next, examples of how the
          personas model the research data shall be described.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research found that users are typically either time-table focused or
          independent study focused. This is captured by the personas through
          Delores being timetable focused and Lee independent study focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research found differences in user goals that related to where in
          their university career students were. Students who were new to
          university tended to be more interested in exploring and socialising;
          these tendencies can be seen in the Lee persona. In contrast,
          students closer to the end of their studies tended to be far more
          interested in working efficiently. Delores, a final year student, has
          these tendencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behaviour of choosing sheltered routes to stay warm and dry
          was found very frequently during user research. The behaviour is
          present in both of the personas.

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <div class="scenarios">
          <div class="scenario-container">
            <div class="scenario">

                src="./assets/wayfinding/scenarios/to-be-scenario.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-nav">
            <div class="slide-btns">
              <a class="prev" onclick="plusScenarios(-1)">&#10094;</a>
              <a class='scenario-btn' onclick="currentScenario(1)"></a>
              <a class='scenario-btn' onclick="currentScenario(2)"></a>
              <a class="next" onclick="plusScenarios(1)">&#10095;</a>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Two scenarios were created. The first was an As-is scenario
          which describes how Delores currently attempts to achieve
          her goals using the existing services. The second scenario
          is a To-be scenario that tells a story of Delores using a
          new system (app) to achieve her goals. The system in the To-be
          scenario aims to improve on that in the As-is scenario.
          The system in the To-be scenario is the system to be designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Claims analysis was used to evaluate the systems in the two
          scenarios. Claims analysis identifies features of interest
          and details the positive and negative attributes of each
          feature. Claims analysis provides a way of comparing,
          critiquing and improving designs. In this instance,
          claims analysis helped establish that the To-be design
          improved on the As-is design by integrating the required
          functionality in a single application so that users
          like Delores do not need to repeatedly switch between applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of scenarios could have been furthered by creating more
          context scenarios which are scenarios that consider at a
          high level how the design supports personas in achieving their goals.
          Other context scenarios could have explored more ways of addressing
          same user goals or ways of addressing different user goals.
          Additionally, more detailed key path scenarios could have
          been created that consider specific interactions with the system.

    <!-- Design and Prototyping  -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Design & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          An low-fidelity interactive prototype was developed based on the
          system described in the To-be scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
          By sketching out wireframes on paper and whiteboards,
          collaboratively the team explored a wide range of
          possible designs.
          Designs were compared and contrasted by considering how
          the personas would find them, how they would perform
          in the scenario and how well they achieve usability goals.
        <p>
          Iteratively, the design was improved and it was created
          in Figma once it has stabilised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interactive prototype was usability tested using both
          Think Aloud testing and Collaborative Heuristic Evaluation (CHE).
          Usability testing is discussed in the next section. Following
          each of the usability tests, parts of the application were
          redesigned in an attempt to address usability problems.

    <!-- Testing  -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Usability testing was used to find problems with the design and areas
          for improvement. The findings were used to improve future iterations
          of the design. Two forms of testing were used which shall now be
          discussed.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-follow">Expert Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The team evaluated the prototype using the expert evaluation method
          Collaborative Heuristic Evaluation (CHE). The evaluation involved, as a
          team, interacting with the prototype and looking for areas where the
          design does not satisfy a predetermined set of design heuristics.
          Nielsen and Molich's heuristics were used. Independently, each team
          member rated the severity of each problem. The problems and their
          rating were then discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two most severe problems that the CHE identified were: icons with
          unclear meanings and insufficient information carry over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design used custom icons. An example is an icon was created
          to symbolise sheltered walking as a mode of travelling. A custom
          icon was used as we were unaware of a pre-existing icon. A potential
          problem with using an icon without an established meaning is that
          its meaning may be unclear to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the potential problem of the meaning of icons being
          unclear, the use of icons was modified such that tapping them would
          open a pop-up with a text description.
        </p>
        <div class="popup">
          <h3>Sheltered Walking Icon & Pop-up Description</h3>
          <img
            src="./assets/wayfinding/testing/shelter.svg"
            class="center-img"
            alt=""
            style="height:100px; width:auto;">
          <img
            src="./assets/wayfinding/testing/popup.svg"
            class="center-img popup-img"
            style="margin-bottom:1em;"
            alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
          The second problem the expert evaluation identified with the design
          was insufficient information carry over. This means that information
          from previous steps is not shown on the succeeding step despite
          being relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an issue as it both gives insufficient feedback to the user
          that the information has been captured and demands the user recall
          the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of this was that the application asked the user what time
          they wanted to arrive by, but, then on the succeeding screen did not
          present the information. The purpose of the succeeding screen was
          route selection, hence, the target arrival time was relevant
          information.

          The following images demonstrate modification of the design to address
          the problem. Note that the images show different iterations of the
          design and that the 'after' iteration features multiple modifications
          that attempt to improve the design.

        <p>
          Think aloud testings, a.k.a. concurrent verbal protocol, was used
          to test the interactive prototype with users. Think aloud testing
          works by asking participants to complete tasks and speak aloud
          their thought process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team tested the interactive prototype with 8 participants
          who were recruited from around the University's campuses. All
          participants were briefed, gave informed consent and were debriefed.
          The tests were conducted by team members working in pairs where one
          member facilitated the test and the other recorded the findings. I and
          the teammate I worked with conducted 4 tests and alternated roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the tests, when the participant encountered problems they were
          asked to rate the severity of the problem. By considering how many
          times problems occur and how severe participants perceive them,
          the significance of problems can be gauged. Based on this we
          went on to modify the design with the goal of addressing problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common occurrence during think aloud testing was that participants
          at first were unsure what components of the application meant or did.
          However, participants were quickly able to learn the meaning
          and functions, they commonly expressed that the behaviour then seemed
          obvious and made sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common participant response was to critique the visual
          appearance of the prototype because of its low fidelity. This
          was not considered a big issue because the prototype was
          intentionally low fidelity at this point. If we had continued
          to develop the design we would have increased the effort put into
          visual design and the testing of it
        </p>
        <p>
          The think aloud testing aloud for us to observe if our solutions to
          previously discovered problems were effective. For example, during
          the testing we observed that participants were unsure what the
          Sheltered Walking icon meant, but, they discovered its meaning
          through the pop-up text description and then were happy interacting
          with it. This indicates that the solution was effective.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          From working on this project I gained experience using UCD.
          I was able to develop skills including: user research, design
          and prototyping, and usability testing. I also gained experience
          working on a substantial design project as a team.

          The assessed report for the project was awarded a
          Distinction mark (85%).
          The marker described the report as excellent and commented that
          “the report had particular strengths in how the user research was
          conducted to elicit user needs and goals [and] the way in which
          the personas and scenarios were clearly grounded in the data
          collected.”
