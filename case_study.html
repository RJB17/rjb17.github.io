    <h1> Case Study: Wayfinding </h2>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          University group project to design and evaluate an interative system
           using user-centred design (UCD) methodology.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Design a wayfinding application to assist people in navigating the
           University's campuses. The application must allow users to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for the location of a room within a building.</li>
          <li>Get directions to a room or building.</li>
          <li>Tailor routes based on specified criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The target users were members of the University</p>
        <h3>Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          I worked in team of 4. I managed, and contributed significently to all
          parts of, the project.
        </p>

    <!-- User Research  -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h3>Related Product Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Relevant existing services were examined to understand how they
          address user goals and need. The services investigated were:
          Google Maps; the Universty's own interactive map; and physical
          navigation signs around the University's campuses. This understanding
          was used to inform interview design.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate each service, it was identified if it implemented each of
          the functions our design was required to and how usable the
          implementation was. Usability was evaluated by considering how well
          it satisfied usability goals. The evaluation could have been improved
          by instead using an expert evaluation method.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          A personas hypothesis (PH) was created to inform interview planning.
          The PH predicts who the users are and their needs and goals.
          It is based on both demographic information and behavoural patterns.
          The PH helps identify who should be interviewed and interview topics.
          Additionally,it documents the designers assumptions enabling them to
          be critiqued.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the target user, members of the University, the PH considered a
          range of behavoural patterns including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why users travel? eg. for class; to shop; to socialise.</li>
          <li>When users travel? eg. during the working day; at night.</li>
          <li>How do users travel? eg. walk; bus; bike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Semi-structured Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          The team conducted 20 semi-structured interviews to learn about the
          users and their goals. Interviews were conducted in pairs such that
          one member acted as the interviewer and the second as a notetaker.
          Google forms was used to capture the participants responses. I, and
          the teammate I worked with conducted 14 interviews and alternated
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semi-structured interviews were chosen becuase ...
        </p>
        <p>
          The interviews had three sections. The first section captured
          demographic information.
