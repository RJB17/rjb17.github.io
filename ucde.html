    <h1> Case Study: Wayfinding </h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          University group project to design and evaluate an interative system
           using user-centred design (UCD) methodology.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Design a wayfinding application to assist people in navigating the
           University's campuses. The application must allow users to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for the location of a room within a building.</li>
          <li>Get directions to a room or building.</li>
          <li>Tailor routes based on specified criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The target users were members of the University</p>
        <h3>Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          I worked in team of 4. I managed, and contributed significently to all
          parts of, the project.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>
          A user-centred design process was used. It was restricted by the
          assessment specifications. The process comprised 4 sets of activities:
          User Research; Personas & Scenarios; Design & Prototyping; and
          Usability Testing. The above diagram illustrates the activity
          sequencing. This case study will next dicuss each of the activities in
          turn.

    <!-- User Research  -->
    <div class="content-panel">
      <div class="inner-content">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h3>Related Product Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Relevant existing services were examined to understand how they
          address user goals and need. The services investigated were:
          Google Maps; the Universty's own interactive map; and physical
          navigation signs around the University's campuses. This understanding
          was used to inform interview design.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate each service, it was identified if it implemented each of
          the functions our design was required to and how usable the
          implementation was. Usability was evaluated by considering how well
          it satisfied usability goals. The evaluation could have been improved
          by instead using an expert evaluation method.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          A personas hypothesis (PH) was created to inform interview planning.
          The PH predicts who the users are and their needs and goals.
          It is based on both demographic information and behavoural patterns.
          The PH helps identify who should be interviewed and interview topics.
          Additionally,it documents the designers assumptions enabling them to
          be critiqued.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the target user, members of the University, the PH considered a
          range of behavoural patterns including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why users travel? eg. for class; to shop; to socialise.</li>
          <li>When users travel? eg. during the working day; at night.</li>
          <li>Where are users travellin to? eg. Library; Cafe; Gym.</li>
          <li>How do users travel? eg. walk; bus; bike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Semi-structured Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          The team conducted 20 semi-structured interviews (SSI) to learn about the
          users and their goals. Interviews were conducted in pairs such that
          one member acted as the interviewer and the second as a notetaker.
          Google forms was used to capture the participants responses. I, and
          the teammate I worked with, conducted 14 interviews and alternated
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assessment specification required the use of either questionniares
          or user interviews. SSI were chosen becuase of their flexibility.
          The SSI format is flexible because it allows the interviewer to probe
          the participant and for the format to be modified during the interview
          process. This flexibility enabled us to use SSI to quickly gain an
          indepth understanding of the target users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interviews were designed to be about 15 minutes long. This length
          was chosen because it would allow for us to recruit and interview a
          suitable number of participants within our time constraints.
          The interviews were comprised of three sections. The first section
          captured the participants background. The second section explored
          participants goals when interacting with campus. The third section
          investigated their current experience when interacting with campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the project had been less contrained by time and the specification,
          a combination of methods could have been used gain a broader and more
          indepth understanding of users. Questionniares would have enabled
          reaching a larger and more diverse set of users. Combining SSI with
          contextual inquiry would have enaled a more indepth understanding of
          users existing practices and goals.

          The research data was modelled using two personas named Delores and
          Lee. The peronas have goals and frustrations. They were
          designed to encapsulate the behavoural patterns that were identified
          in the user research.

        <p>
          Two scenarios were created. The first was an <em>As-is</em> scenario
          which describes how Delores currently attempts to achieve her goals
          using the existing services. The second scenario is a <em>To-be</em>
          scenario that tell a story of how Delores using a new system (app) to
          achieve her goals. The system in the To-be scenario aims to improve on
          that in the As-is scenario. The system in the To-be scenario is the
          system to be designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Claims analysis</em> was used to evaluate the systems in the two
          scenarios. Claims analyis identifies features of interest and
          detials the positive and negative attributes of each feature. Claims
          analyis provides a way of comparing, critiquing and improving designs.
          In this instance, claims analysis helped establish that the To-be
          design improved on the As-is design integrating the required
          functionality in a single application so that users like Delores do
          not need to repeatedly switch between applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of scenarios could have been furthered by creating more
          <em> context scenarios </em> which are scenarios that consider at a
          high level how the design supports personas in achieving their goals.
          Other context scenarios could have explored more ways of addressing
          same user goals or ways of addressing different user goals.
          Additionally, more detailed <em>key path</em> scenarios could have
          been created that consider specific interactions with the system.

        <h2>Design & Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          An low-fidelity interactive prototype was developed based on the
          system described in the To-be scenario. By sketching out wireframes
          on paper and whiteboards, collaboratively the team explored a wide
          range of possible designs. Designs were compared and contrasted by
          considering how the personas would find them, how they would perform
          in the scenario and how well they meet usability goals. Iteratively,
          the design was improved and it was created in Figma once it has
          stabilised.

        The team evaluated the prototype using the expert evalutation method

        design does not satisfy a predetirmined set of design heuristics.
        Nielsen and Molich's heuristics were used. Independently, each team
